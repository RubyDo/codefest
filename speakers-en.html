Jane Hazel, Director General of the Public Affairs Directorate at Health Canada, will share her experience moving from an organization-based website to a theme-based website.

											<h3 class="h5">Integral UX Research – Shopify Perspective</h3>
											<p>When we talk about human-centered design, we usually think first of human purpose and pleasure. When we bring 'life' into the equation, we zoom out and see humans in the complex contexts of their everyday lives. 'Life-centered' design encourages us to consider all the people, animate and inanimate objects, environments, and systems that humans interact with. Taking a 'life-centred' approach to design can change not only what we create, but also the way we think, the way we behave, and the way we communicate to truly improve people’s lives. How do we take the domains of life, the universe and everything in between into consideration when creating virtual and physical retail experiences that are functional, beautiful, and above all useful?  </p>

											<h3 class="h5">The Joy and the Pain of Building with Everyone</h3>
											<p>Open projects have made huge improvements to government technology from the perspectives of better design, better code, better data, and better process, to name only a few. The highest impact teams working in the civic space usually combine several of these perspectives, and that means coordinating members with vastly different backgrounds, work styles, and assumptions. This is both challenging and fun.</p>
											<p>Cyd will share examples from Code for America’s past and current open-source work for US local governments, all of which were developed by multidisciplinary teams working in public. She’ll discuss the pitfalls, the happy surprises, and why the potential to transform the citizen experience is greater than ever as more types of geeks join the movement.</p>

											<h3 class="h5">About Cyd</h3>
											<p>Cyd is a passionate advocate for the citizen experience. She's an accomplished user experience (UX) researcher and currently serves as Code for America's UX Evangelist. She's also a Twitter haikuist. Cyd wants to redesign interaction between government and its citizens to create a virtuous cycle of trust. She envisions a world where civic interactions are just as inviting and rewarding as commercial ones.</p>
											<p>At Code for America, Cyd works with fellows, city officials, and community volunteers to help create inventive and cost-effective civic technology that serves the needs of real people. In 2014, she is working closely with the city of Oakland CA to redesign the redesign process for local government websites. She uses her unique background in sociolinguistics and poetry to apply metaphorical thinking to human-centered design.</p>
